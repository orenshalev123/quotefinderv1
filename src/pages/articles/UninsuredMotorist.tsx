      <p>
        Despite legal requirements, many drivers on the road don't carry adequate insurance—or any insurance at all. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage protects you from financial losses when you're in an accident with one of these drivers.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage?</h2>
      <p>
        Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage protects you when you're involved in an accident with a driver who has no insurance. This coverage typically has two components:
      </p>
      
      <h3>Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI)</h3>
      <p>
        This covers medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and, in the worst cases, funeral expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured driver.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD)</h3>
      <p>
        Available in some states, this covers damage to your vehicle caused by an uninsured driver. It may also cover hit-and-run accidents in some states.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage?</h2>
      <p>
        Underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage kicks in when you're in an accident with a driver who has insurance, but their coverage limits are too low to fully pay for the damage or injuries they caused. This coverage helps bridge the gap between the at-fault driver's insurance limits and the actual costs of your damages.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why You Should Consider UM/UIM Coverage</h2>
      
      <h3>The Prevalence of Uninsured Drivers</h3>
      <p>
        According to the Insurance Research Council, about one in eight drivers in the United States is uninsured. In some states, the rate is even higher—reaching nearly 30% in certain areas. This means there's a significant chance you could be involved in an accident with an uninsured driver.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The Limits of Health Insurance</h3>
      <p>
        While your health insurance might cover some medical expenses after an accident, it won't cover everything that UM/UIM coverage does, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain and suffering</li>
        <li>Lost wages</li>
        <li>Long-term care or disability</li>
        <li>Deductibles and copays from your health insurance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Protection Beyond Collision Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        Collision coverage will pay for repairs to your vehicle regardless of fault, but it won't cover medical expenses, lost wages, or pain and suffering. Additionally, you'll still have to pay your deductible, which could be substantial.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Is UM/UIM Coverage Required?</h2>
      <p>
        Requirements vary by state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>About 20 states require some form of UM coverage</li>
        <li>A smaller number require UIM coverage</li>
        <li>Even in states where it's not required, insurance companies must offer these coverages, though you may have the option to reject them in writing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How Much Coverage Do You Need?</h2>
      <p>
        Experts generally recommend that your UM/UIM limits match your liability limits. If you carry 100/300 liability coverage ($100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident), you should consider having the same limits for your UM/UIM coverage.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
      
      <h3>Stacked vs. Non-Stacked Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        In some states, you can "stack" your UM/UIM coverage, which increases your protection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intra-policy stacking:</strong> If you have multiple vehicles on one policy, you can multiply your coverage limits by the number of vehicles</li>
        <li><strong>Inter-policy stacking:</strong> If you have multiple policies, you can combine the limits from each policy</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Hit-and-Run Accidents</h3>
      <p>
        In many states, UM coverage extends to hit-and-run accidents, providing crucial protection when the at-fault driver can't be identified. However, some states have restrictions or require physical contact between vehicles for coverage to apply.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Cost vs. Benefit</h2>
      <p>
        UM/UIM coverage is relatively inexpensive compared to the protection it provides. On average, it adds about 5-10% to your premium—a small price to pay for the significant financial protection it offers.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        Given the prevalence of uninsured and underinsured drivers and the potentially devastating financial consequences of an accident with one, UM/UIM coverage is a valuable addition to your auto insurance policy. It provides peace of mind knowing that you and your passengers will be protected, regardless of the other driver's insurance status.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When reviewing your auto insurance policy, carefully consider the potential risks of driving without this coverage—the small additional cost often far outweighs the potential financial impact of being involved in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver.
