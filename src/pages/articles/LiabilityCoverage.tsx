      <p>
        Liability coverage is the foundation of any auto insurance policy and is required by law in most states. This coverage protects you financially if you're responsible for injuring someone or damaging their property in an auto accident.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What Is Liability Coverage?</h2>
      <p>
        Liability insurance covers the costs associated with damages and injuries you cause to others in an accident where you're at fault. It does not cover your own injuries or damage to your vehicle—those would be covered by other types of insurance like personal injury protection or collision coverage.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Two Components of Liability Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        Liability coverage consists of two distinct parts:
      </p>
      
      <h3>1. Bodily Injury Liability (BI)</h3>
      <p>
        Bodily injury liability covers costs related to injuries or death that you cause to others in an auto accident. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical expenses</li>
        <li>Lost wages</li>
        <li>Pain and suffering</li>
        <li>Legal fees if you're sued</li>
        <li>Funeral expenses in the event of a fatal accident</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. Property Damage Liability (PD)</h3>
      <p>
        Property damage liability covers damage you cause to other people's property, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage to other vehicles</li>
        <li>Damage to structures (fences, buildings, etc.)</li>
        <li>Damage to objects (lamp posts, mailboxes, etc.)</li>
        <li>Legal costs if you're sued for property damage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Understanding Liability Coverage Limits</h2>
      <p>
        Liability coverage is expressed as three numbers, such as 100/300/50. Here's what these numbers mean:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The first number (100)</strong>: The maximum payment (in thousands) for bodily injury per person ($100,000)</li>
        <li><strong>The second number (300)</strong>: The maximum payment (in thousands) for bodily injury per accident ($300,000)</li>
        <li><strong>The third number (50)</strong>: The maximum payment (in thousands) for property damage per accident ($50,000)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        If your policy has limits of 100/300/50 and you cause an accident that injures three people and damages property:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your insurance would pay up to $100,000 for each injured person, but no more than $300,000 total for all injuries</li>
        <li>Your insurance would pay up to $50,000 for property damage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        If damages exceed these limits, you would be personally responsible for the difference.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Minimum Requirements vs. Recommended Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        Each state sets minimum liability requirements, but these minimums are often insufficient to fully protect your assets in a serious accident. Medical costs and legal settlements can quickly exceed minimum limits.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Insurance experts typically recommend liability limits of at least:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>$100,000 bodily injury per person</li>
        <li>$300,000 bodily injury per accident</li>
        <li>$100,000 property damage per accident</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Higher limits are advisable if you have significant assets to protect or live in an area with high medical costs.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Split Limits vs. Combined Single Limit (CSL)</h2>
      <p>
        Most liability policies use split limits as described above. However, some insurers offer a combined single limit (CSL) policy, which provides one overall limit that can be applied to any combination of bodily injury or property damage claims.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For example, a policy with a $300,000 CSL would cover up to $300,000 in total damages, regardless of how they're distributed between bodily injury and property damage.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Importance of Adequate Liability Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        Having adequate liability coverage is crucial for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asset Protection:</strong> If damages exceed your coverage limits, your personal assets—including your home, savings, and future wages—could be at risk in a lawsuit.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Driving without the state-required minimum liability insurance can result in fines, license suspension, and other penalties.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Knowing you have sufficient coverage can provide security when on the road.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        When selecting liability coverage, consider your financial situation, assets, and risk tolerance. Remember that increasing your liability limits often costs relatively little compared to the additional protection it provides.
